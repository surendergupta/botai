## Features

1. **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can interact with a mock AI chatbot, and the bot's responses are fetched from a JSON file (`sampleData.json`).
2. **Thumbs Up/Down Feedback**: Users can like or dislike the bot's responses by hovering over a message and using the floating thumbs up/down buttons.
3. **End-of-Conversation Feedback**: Users can provide a rating (out of 5) and give subjective feedback at the end of each conversation.
4. **Conversation History**: Conversations are automatically saved and can be revisited through a sidebar or top navigation panel. Each saved conversation includes the user's feedback.
5. **Feedback Review**: Users can view a summary of feedback across multiple conversations and filter them based on rating. The feedback is presented in a well-organized, sortable table.
6. **Multiple Conversations**: The app supports multiple chat sessions, allowing users to start new conversations while preserving previous ones.
7. **Responsive Design**: The application is built with a focus on UI/UX using Material UI, ensuring responsiveness across different device sizes.
